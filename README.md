# lfs-x86-rpms
A set of RPMs for building a Linux from Scratch (LFS) system. Closely follows cross-compilation instructions from https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/.

This has been built for my own practice. While anyone is free to use these, consider following instructions for the Linux from Scratch project for a bigger brain.
